   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Maps container port 80 to host port 8080, making a web server accessible on `localhost:8080`.

### **2. Exposing Multiple Ports**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 nginx
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Allows access to multiple services (e.g., HTTP and HTTPS) within a single container.

### **3. Declaring Ports in a Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   EXPOSE 80 443
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Documents the ports that the container listens on, although you still need to use `-p` to expose them externally.

---

## **Chapter 7: Using Environment Variables**

Environment variables let you configure applications without modifying code, making containers flexible and portable.

### **1. Setting Variables with `docker run`**
   ```bash
   docker run -e MY_VARIABLE=myvalue nginx
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Passes configuration data dynamically to the container.

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env myapp
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Manages complex configurations easily by storing them in an external file.

---

## **Chapter 8: Docker Volumes and Persisting Data**

Volumes are used to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container, crucial for databases and other stateful applications.

### **1. Creating a Volume**
   ```bash
   docker volume create my_volume
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Creates a storage space that persists even after containers stop or are removed.

### **2. Mounting a Volume in a Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -v my_volume:/data ubuntu
   ```
   - **Benefit**: Ensures data in `/data` is saved even if the container is deleted.

### **3. Using Bind Mounts**
   ```bash
   docker run -v /host/path:/container/path ubuntu
   ```
